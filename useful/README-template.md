## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets: [https://sass-lang.com/]

### What I learned

Despite being a small project, in this my first Frontend Mentor challenge I tried to use as many of the tools and concepts I learned in CSS, HTML, and Sass as possible. "Semantic markup, grid, variables, mixins with arguments, etc."

I tried naming my classes following BEM naming convention."But honestly... I don't know if I did it right"

This was also my first experience using Git and Github, so... Please, if you have tips on how I can improve my future projects, leave a comment.

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to be more comfortable working with:

- Alignment of objects vertically.
- More complex grids.

I'm also studying Javascript, I hope to be able to work on more complex challenges soon.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Grid - CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - "Our comprehensive guide to CSS grid, focusing on all the settings both for the grid parent container and the grid child elements."

- [Site Shot](https://www.site-shot.com/) - As the name suggests... This site is for taking screenshots of web pages. "You can choose the resolution, format, and other settings"

- [Box-Shadow CSS Generator - HTML-CSS-JS](https://html-css-js.com/css/generator/box-shadow/) - Creating box shadows is much easier with this tool.
